# Smart Traffic Light AI (Nairobi Prototype)

This project uses AI to analyze real-world traffic patterns and suggest smarter traffic light behavior in Kenya's chaotic intersections.

## Current Features

- Load and read traffic video
- Display frame-by-frame for inspection

## Next Goals

- Detect and count vehicles
- Identify congestion hotspots
- Simulate adaptive traffic light logic

## Tools

- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy / Matplotlib
- (Later) TensorFlow or PyTorch

## Author

- Sanja Timothy, CS Student - Nairobi
