# ðŸš¦ Smart AI-Powered Traffic Light System (Nairobi Prototype)

This project uses computer vision and AI to analyze real-world traffic patterns from video and simulate intelligent, adaptive traffic light behavior â€” starting with Nairobi's chaotic intersections.


## Current Features

- Load, process, and display traffic videos frame-by-frame
- Polygon-based multi-zone detection (user-defined zones)
- Object detection using YOLOv8
- Multi-object tracking using ByteTrack
- Vehicle counting per zone



## Next Goals

- Replace ID-based counting logic with center-point or bounding-box based strategies to reduce overcounting
- Add vehicle type classification (car, truck, motorcycle, etc.)
- Detect congestion levels per zone
- Train reinforcement learning agent to control traffic light phases
- Simulate smart light decision-making in real time
- Build admin dashboard for real-world monitoring and testing



## Tools & Stack

- Python 3.12
- OpenCV
- NumPy / Matplotlib
- Ultralytics YOLOv8
- ByteTrack
- Git, GitHub, VS Code
